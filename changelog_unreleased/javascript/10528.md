#### Improve detection of AMD `define` (#10528 by @thorn0)

Prettier special-cases AMD `define` calls to avoid unexpected line breaks in them. `define` calls that weren't expression statements and had nothing to do with AMD were formatted this way too. This happens no longer.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const someVariable = define(
  "some string literal",
  anotherVariable,
  yetAnotherVariable
);

// Prettier stable
const someVariable = define("some string literal", anotherVariable, yetAnotherVariable);

// Prettier main
const someVariable = define(
  "some string literal",
  anotherVariable,
  yetAnotherVariable
);
```
