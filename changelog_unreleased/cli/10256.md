#### Don't skip file paths containing special words like `constructor` (#10256 by @ashlkv)

Directories whose names happened to coincide with the properties of `Object.prototype` were ignored by Prettier CLI because of a classic bug (introduced in Prettier 2.0.0) with object properties not being checked for being own.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```sh
# Prettier stable
$ prettier 'js/constructor/*.js' --write
[error] No matching files. Patterns: js/constructor/*.js

# Prettier main
prettier 'js/constructor/*.js' --write
js/constructor/test.js 42ms
```
