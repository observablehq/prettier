#### Round-trippable `--debug-print-doc` (#10169, #10177 by @thorn0)

The idea is to make the output of `--debug-print-doc` closer to actual code for generating docs (Prettier's intermediate representation). Ideally, it should be possible for it to work without modification after copy-pasting into a JS file. That ideal hasn't probably been reached by this PR, but it's pretty close. This is going to make `--debug-print-doc` and the corresponding part of the Playground a bit more useful.
